return (
  <SuperAdminLayout user={auth.user}>
    {/* Your page content */}
  </SuperAdminLayout>
)
```

### 2. Using RoleBasedLayout (Automatic)
```typescript
// Automatically selects layout based on user role
import RoleBasedLayout from '@/layouts/RoleBasedLayout'

return (
  <RoleBasedLayout user={auth.user}>

  </RoleBasedLayout>
)
```

### 3. Customizing Layouts
Each layout can be customized by:
- Modifying menu items in the respective layout file
